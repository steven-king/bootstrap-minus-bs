This repo contains an altered form of Twitter.BootStrap. It was changed so students learning CSS will not depend on the already created styles but will be forced to learn how to write their own CSS. Simple example and scaffolding. Thats it!

This is just a starting point for my students learning css. Experienced CSS developers should use twitter.bootstrap.

Changes from orig bootstrap: The bootstra.css files is commenteded out. Links to non-essential JS files are removed. BS Nav bar removed (So students will be forced to build it themeselves.

Added app.css file for added styles. Added several styles just to demenstrate basic responsive techniques (.gray-box, .nav)
